# Overview

I have a love for writing mobile apps! I want to be a mobile app developer but my experience in mobile apps so far has been in swift. I want to have all possible opportunities open to me and be a more well rounded developer so I decied to start experimenting with kotlin.

I wrote a basic math game to practice flash cards. It allows you to set a number you want to practice and the operand you want to practice. I used a class to handle the gameplay to gain a better understanding of object oriented programming in Kotlin.

My purpose in writing this app is to build a prototype for a mobile app that has the same functionality. I would like to get all of the code working now so I can develop this into a mobile app and only have to implement screen input and output.
